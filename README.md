# NgGuardKickStart 🚀🔥
A simple boilerplate to demo Angular's Router, Guards.
I created this angular boilerplate to kick start my angular projects.

## ✨ Features
- Angular Router setup
- Route Guards setup
- Role based Guards (Admin & User roles)
- A simple example of accessing Route Parameter

# 🛣 Routes
- `/` redirects to `/home`
- `/home`- Homepage of the app
- `/login` - If user is logged in, it redirects Users back to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` redirects to `/dashboard/home`
- `/dashboard/home` - Dashboard home (Both User and Admin can view)
- `/dashboard/admin` -  Admin specific dashboard
- `/dashboard/products/:id`
- `/404` - 404 page 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5.

# Development server
