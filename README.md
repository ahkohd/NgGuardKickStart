# NgGuardKickStart ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
A simple boilerplate to demo Angular's Router, Guards.
I created this angular boilerplate to kick start my angular projects.

## âœ¨ Features
- Angular Router setup
- Route Guards setup
- Role based Guards (Admin & User roles)
- A simple example of accessing Route Parameter

# ðŸ›£ Routes
- `/` redirects to `/home`
- `/home`- Homepage of the app
- `/login` - If user is logged in, it redirects Users back to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` redirects to `/dashboard/home`
- `/dashboard/home` - Dashboard home (Both User and Admin can view)
- `/dashboard/admin` -  Admin specific dashboard
- `/dashboard/products/:id`
- `/404` - 404 page
